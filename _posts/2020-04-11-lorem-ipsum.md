GitHub, a place for collaboration,
Where coders share ideas and their creations.
It’s a hub for all tech minds to come together,
And come up with projects that last forever.

You can find projects of any size and scope,
From simple ones to a complex scope.
A place where you learn more and more each day,
As you work your way up the programming highway.

It’s a place to share knowledge and experience,
Where everyone can help each other in some sense. 
A place where people can solve problems together, 
Making sure everyone is on the same page no matter the weather. 

GitHub is a great resource for developers of all kinds, 
It  is my pleasure to join you today

It is a pleasure to be here with all of you today. I'm looking forward to learning more about the topic and participating in the discussion.
